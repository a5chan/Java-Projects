Most of this portfolio, like the projects were done on my free time during university. Most of the code has 
not been properly indented, but I will try my best to update as I go along since the term is getting busy.  

SOME CONCEPTS THAT ARE SHOWN

- Recursion
- For/while loops
- Java swing use
- GUI's, animations, and drawing
- Text output, input.
- If-else statements and use of arrays
- Different functions in Java
- Some traces of debugging are left (like system.out.println certain variables inside my project main java files)
- Use of try-catch
- JOptionPane and different libraries
- Examples of classes and object oriented programming.
- JQuery, JSON, and use of Rest API's.
- Javascript, HTML, and CSS.

- Other stuff like PHP, Ruby, .NET and SQL experience were all done during my previous job, 
so there is no way I can upload their code onto my github.

C ++ experience comes from the similarity to Java and the fact that I learned it in my 1A term.
